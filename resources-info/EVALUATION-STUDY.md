# EVALUATION STUDY - SCOPE OUT PROJECT
- Doc containing a prelimiary study of where to go from the observability submission from Ben and Simon to a complete eval system that can be implemented into Twiga.

## Base observability project
- What does it consist of and which parts are most useful to us going forward?

## Evaluation metrics
- Which metrics are we looking for and what are our primary concerns in evaluating Twiga.

## Industry standards
- This has been done before; what methods are used and how is Twiga different? What are we concerned with that is different than the primary model providers and tools using LLMs out there that are conducting extensive LLM evaluation?

## NEXT STEPS
- What needs to be added/implemented/built specifically to have more robust evaluation and observability?
